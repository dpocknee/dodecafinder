#dodecafinder
There are 479 million possible 12-tone rows (12! = 479,001,600). This makes doing a brute-force search for a row with specific characteristics time-consuming and computationally intensive. Dodecafinder uses a genetic algorithmic approach to reduce the time and computation needed to find rows which optimally match a given set of characteristics.

You will need the gem fxruby installed for the gui to work.
